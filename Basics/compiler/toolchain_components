Runtime Libraries:

Several runtime libraries are required by gcc  to build complete applications

The compiler support library : (libgcc )
-----------------------------------------------------
and is provided by the compiler itself to supply low-level compiler support routines such as software floating-point emulation 
and support for exception-handling. 

This library is used by virtually all programs compiled with GCC.


C runtime library ( glibc/uclibc/newlib)
-------------------

The C runtime library contains ISO C functions, like printf() and memcpy(). The three most popular C libraries used with the GNU toolchain are the GNU C Library (GLIBC), uClibc, and Newlib:

    GLIBC is a full-featured, POSIX-compliant C library designed for use with the Linux kernel. In addition to those functions required by ISO C, it includes functions required by POSIX, functions provided in other UNIX C libraries, and GNU extensions.

    uClibc is a smaller footprint library (also designed for use with the LinuxÂ® kernel) that contains a subset of the GLIBC functionality. You can use uClibc on either GNU/Linux or uClinux.

    Newlib, generally used on bare-metal targets, has an even smaller footprint, but provides significantly reduced functionality.
