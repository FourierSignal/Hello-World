binutils
Clibrary - glibc /newlib/uclib
gcc




glibc and gcc require binutils - so compile binutils first.


gcc comes with a library libgcc which needs glibc
inter dependency between gcc and glibc


so we compile  primitive gcc.
If primitive gcc compiles full we are lucky.
if primitive gcc fails because of some dependency.we have to install incomplete compiler 

with this incomplete gcc compiler , we can build some parts of C library
with the incomplete Clibrary , we can try building full gcc compiler.
if have to iterate between incomplete gcc compiler and incomplete c library
at least untill full C-library is built

the simplest way of installing incomplete gcc is to use make; make install with -k option
so that make continues even with errors,skipping the failing parts(supporting libraries).


glibc building
--host should be different  as glibc should run on target
--prefix should also be different as it should be placed in target specific sub directory within the installation directory
additionally we need to tell where kerenel heads are available

after installing glibc 
 copy kernel headers into target specific directory
 include/linux --- into  arm-linux/include/linux
 include/asm-arm --- into arm-linux/include/asm
 latest kerenels also want 
 include/asm-generic --- into arm-linux/include/asm-generic
 
 building Full-compiler
