▶arm-buildroot-linux-uclibcgnueabihf/
▶bin/
   Limited set of binutils programs, without their cross-compilation prefix.
   Hard links to their counter parts with the prefix. This is where gcc finds them.
▶include/c++/4.9.4/
  Headers for the C++ standard library, installed bygcc
  Interestingly, they are not part of the sysroot per-se.
▶lib/
  The gcc run time libraries, built for the target
  libatomic, provides a software implementation of atomic built-ins, when needed
  libgcc, the maingccruntime (optimized functions, 64-bit division, floating pointemulation)
  libitm, transactional memory library
  libstdc++, standard C++ library
  libsupc++, subset oflibstdc++with only thelanguage supportfunctions
 ▶sysroot/
    ▶lib/,usr/lib/: C library and gcc runtime libraries (shared and static)
    ▶usr/include/, Linux kernel and C library headers

   ▶arm-buildroot-linux-uclibcgnueabihf-prefixed tools
   ▶Frombinutils: addr2line, ar, as, elfedit, gcov, gprof, ld, nm, objcopy, objdump,ranlib, 
        readelf, size, strings, strip
   ▶Fromgcc: c++ (same as g++), cc (same as gcc), cpp, g++, gcc, gcc-ar, gcc-nm,gcc-ranlib
   ▶Thegcc-{ar,nm,ranlib}are wrappers for the corresponding binutils program, 
        tosupport Link Time Optimization (LTO)

     crtbegin*.o,crtend*.o, object files handling constructors/destructors, linked intoexecutables
     ▶include/,
        headers provided by the compiler (stdarg.h,stdint.h,stdatomic.h, etc.)
     ▶include-fixed/,
        system headers that gcc fixed up usingfixincludes
     ▶install-tools/, 
        also related to the fix includes process
     ▶libgcc.a,libgcc_eh.a,libgcov.a, static variants of the gcc runtime libraries
     ▶ldscripts/, linker scripts provided bygccto link programs and libraries
