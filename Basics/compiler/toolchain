   Hard links to their counter parts with the prefix. This is where gcc finds them.
▶include/c++/4.9.4/
  Headers for the C++ standard library, installed bygcc
  Interestingly, they are not part of the sysroot per-se.
▶lib/
  The gcc run time libraries, built for the target
  libatomic, provides a software implementation of atomic built-ins, when needed
  libgcc, the maingccruntime (optimized functions, 64-bit division, floating pointemulation)
  libitm, transactional memory library
  libstdc++, standard C++ library
  libsupc++, subset oflibstdc++with only thelanguage supportfunctions
