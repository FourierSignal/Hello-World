internal power supply turns on, initializes and then takes a few moments to generate reliable power supply
motherboard's chipset will generate a reset signal to the processor.
After a Power Good signal is received, or after the reset button is released and there is confirmation of reliable power, the processor will be ready to start executing. 

the processor to always look at the same place in the system, the BIOS ROM, for the small bit of startup code to begin the boot process.
This is typically located at memory location FFFF0h, or right at the end of the system memory.
Since there are only 16 bytes from there to the end of conventional memory area, this location contains just a "jump" instruction telling the processor where to go to find the real BIOS startup program.

The BIOS performs the power-on self test (POST).
If there are any fatal errors, the boot process stops. 
If the POST is successful, the BIOS calls INT 19 (Interrupt 19) and then proceeds to look for devices attached to the motherboard.

The BIOS code begins its search by looking for a video card, 
more particularly, its looking for the video card's built in BIOS program, (normally found at location C000h in memory) 
and if found, runs it. The system BIOS executes the video card BIOS, which in turn initializes the video card.
Most modern video cards will display information on the screen about the video card, before you see the messages from the system BIOS itself.


BIOS prom chip  on motherboard: has small code :system BIOS
BIOS ROM finds out MBR of Harddisk
boot code in MBR invokes GRUB.
GRUB loads linux vmlinuz-x.x.x-x-name in /boot
kernel need a filesystem containing drivers available to it at boot time:"initrd" (initial RAM disk) or "initramfs" 
/boot/initrd.img-x.x.x.x-name is initrd
GRUB will load the kernel at a location in memory, and the initrd at a different location, 
and jump to the kernel telling it where the initrd is, starting Linux.


MBR(Master boot record)/Master boot sector/boot sector:
--------------------------------------------------------
is always located at cylinder 0, head 0, and sector 1, the first sector on the disk.

The master boot record contains the following structures:

Master Partition Table: 
This small bit of code/table: describing partitions on the hard disk. 
When the developers designed the size of this master partition table, they left just enough room for the description of four partitions.
hence the four partition (physical partitions/primary partitions.) limit.
Any additional partitions must be logical partitions that are linked to (or are part of) one of the primary partitions.
One of these primary partitions is marked as active, indicating that it is the one that the computer should used to continue the boot process.

Master Boot Code: 
The master boot record is the small bit of computer code that the BIOS loads and executes to start the boot process. 
This code transfers control to the boot program stored on the boot (active) partition to load the operating system.





download a more recent kernel from kernel.org 
create a new kernel binary image
make or update an initrd with drivers that work with that kernel
