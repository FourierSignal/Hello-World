BIOS process:
------------------------------------
internal power supply turns on, initializes and then takes a few moments to generate reliable power supply
motherboard's chipset will generate a reset signal to the processor.
After a Power Good signal is received, or after the reset button is released and there is confirmation of reliable power, the processor will be ready to start executing. 

the processor to always look at the same place in the system, the BIOS ROM, for the small bit of startup code to begin the boot process.
This is typically located at memory location FFFF0h, or right at the end of the system memory.
Since there are only 16 bytes from there to the end of conventional memory area, this location contains just a "jump" instruction telling the processor where to go to find the real BIOS startup program.

POST:
The BIOS performs the power-on self test (POST).
If there are any fatal errors, the boot process stops. 
If the POST is successful, the BIOS calls INT 19 (Interrupt 19) and then proceeds to look for devices attached to the motherboard.

INT19 process:
The BIOS code begins its search by looking for a video card, 
more particularly, its looking for the video card's built in BIOS program, (normally found at location C000h in memory) 
and if found, runs it. The system BIOS executes the video card BIOS, which in turn initializes the video card.
Most modern video cards will display information on the screen about the video card, before you see the messages from the system BIOS itself.

Once video has been enabled, the BIOS begins searching for other devices that may have their own ROM and whether that ROM has its own BIOS code.
If a floppy and/or hard drive is found, their codes are executed. If, during this INT 19 process, any other device BIOS's are found, they are executed as well.

The BIOS displays its startup screen.
the BIOS continues to perform additional tests:memory count.
it performs somewhat of an inventory of the hardware.
the BIOS will display a summary screen with your system's configuration.

depending on the boot sequence selected,Once the BIOS identifies its target boot drive, 
the it looks for boot information to start the operating system boot process. 
If it is searching a hard disk, it looks for a master boot record at cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1, the first sector on the disk
Next, the small program in the Master Boot Record will attempt to locate an active (bootable) partition in the hard drives partition table.
If such a partition is found, the boot sector of that partition is also read into memory at location 0000:7C00 
and then MBR program itself jumps to memory location 0000:7C00. 
Keep in mind that each operating system has its own boot sector format. 

the small program in the boot sector locating the first part of the operating system's kernel loader program
or in some cases the kernel itself or perhaps a boot manager program, and read then that into memory. 
For you Windows NT and Windows 2000 :this kernel loader is referred to as NTLDR.

If no boot device of any type can be found, the system will display an error message and stop
error message can range from "No boot device" to the very cryptic "NO ROM BASIC - SYSTEM HALTED".
This will also happen if you have a bootable hard disk partition but forget to set it active.

In summary , If an active partition is found, regardless of where it is found,
that partition's boot record is read into memory at 0000:7c00
and then the MBR code is added to 0000:7c00 pointing to the partition table entry that describes the partition being booted.
The boot record program uses this data to determine the drive being booted from and the exact location of the partition on the disk. 
If no active partition table entry can be found, the boot process enters ROM BASIC via INT 18.
All other errors will cause the system to hang or stop.

This entire process is referred to as a "cold boot" (since the machine was off, or cold, when it started). 
A "warm boot" also known as a "soft boot" is the same thing except it occurs when the machine is rebooted using the Ctrl + Alt + Del keys.
In this case the POST is skipped and the boot process continues to INT 19 .
On most systems, Ctrl + Alt + Del causes a soft-boot.





Kernel boot process
------------------------
BIOS prom chip  on motherboard: has small code :system BIOS
The BIOS performs several steps to test the system and make it ready before an operating system can be loaded.
Once the BIOS has completed its testing and system configuration, it begins the process of loading the operating system.
searching the installed drives for a Master Boot Record in which is contained a boot code.
BIOS ROM finds out MBR of Harddisk
boot code in MBR invokes GRUB.
GRUB loads linux vmlinuz-x.x.x-x-name in /boot
kernel need a filesystem containing drivers available to it at boot time:"initrd" (initial RAM disk) or "initramfs" 
/boot/initrd.img-x.x.x.x-name is initrd
GRUB will load the kernel at a location in memory, and the initrd at a different location, 
and jump to the kernel telling it where the initrd is, starting Linux.


MBR(Master boot record)/Master boot sector/boot sector:
--------------------------------------------------------
is always located at cylinder 0, head 0, and sector 1, the first sector on the disk.

The master boot record contains the following structures:

Master Partition Table: 
This small bit of code/table: describing partitions on the hard disk. 
When the developers designed the size of this master partition table, they left just enough room for the description of four partitions.
hence the four partition (physical partitions/primary partitions.) limit.
Any additional partitions must be logical partitions that are linked to (or are part of) one of the primary partitions.
One of these primary partitions is marked as active, indicating that it is the one that the computer should used to continue the boot process.

Master Boot Code: 
The master boot record is the small bit of computer code that the BIOS loads and executes to start the boot process. 
This code transfers control to the boot program stored on the boot (active) partition to load the operating system.

Many things can damage the Master Boot Record, 
therefore it might be helpful for you to know where certain portions of the code reside in the MBR, should you have to recover the MBR manually.
You will find that:
    The MBR program code starts at offset 0000.
    The MBR messages start at offset 008b.
    The partition table starts at offset 01be.
    The signature is at offset 01fe.

Notes (Extremely Important):

The first byte of an active partition table entry is 80.
This byte is loaded into the DL register before INT 13 is called to read the boot sector.
When INT 13 is called, DL is the BIOS device number. 
Because of this, the boot sector read by this MBR program can only be read from BIOS device number 80 (the first hard disk). 
This is one of the reasons why it is usually not possible to boot from any other hard disk.
Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but those are beyond the scope of this text.

The MBR program uses the CHS based INT 13H AH=02H call to read the boot sector of the active partition. 
The location of the active partition's boot sector is in the partition table entry in CHS format.
If the drive is 528MB, this CHS must be a translated CHS. No addresses in LBA form are used (another reason why LBA does not solve the 528MB problem).

The MS-DOS Boot Process:

If the operating system is MS-DOS or any variant of Windows(other than WindowsNT or Windows2000):
process starts out by booting the equivalent of DOS, then a specific operating system load sequence commences, which is referred to as the DOS Boot Process.
i.e If you are booting into Windows, additional steps are performed after the underlying MS-DOS operating system has loaded.

MS-DOS boot process:

    The BIOS, having completed its test and setup functions, loads the boot code found in the master boot record and then transfers control of the system to it. At that point, the master boot record code is executed. If the boot device is a floppy disk, the process skips to step 7 below.

    The next step in the process is the master boot code examining the master partition table. It first must determine if there is an extended DOS partition, then it must determine if there is a bootable partition specified in the partition table.

    If the master boot code locates an extended partition on the disk, it loads the extended partition table that describes the first logical volume in the extended partition. This extended partition table is examined to see if it points to another extended partition table. If it does, this second table is examined for information about the second logical volume in the extended partition. Logical volumes in the extended partition have their extended partition table chained together one to the next. This process continues until all of the extended partitions have been loaded and recognized by the system.

    Once the extended partition information (if any) has been loaded, the boot code attempts to start the primary partition that is marked active, referred to as the boot partition. If no boot partitions are marked active, then the boot process will terminate with an error. The error message is often the same as that which occurs if the BIOS could not locate a boot device, generally shown on screen as "No boot device", but also can show up as "NO ROM BASIC - SYSTEM HALTED". If there is a primary partition marked active and there is an installed operating system, the boot code will boot it. The rest of the steps presume this example is of an MS- DOS primary partition.

    At this stage, the master or volume boot sector is loaded into memory and tested, and the boot code that it contains is given control of the remainder of the boot process.

    The boot code examines the disk structures to ensure that everything is correct. If not, the boot process will end in an error here.

    During the next step, the boot code searches the root directory of the device being booted for the operating system files that contain the operating system. For MS-DOS, these are the files "IO.SYS", "MSDOS.SYS" and "COMMAND.COM".

    If no operating system files are found, the boot program will display an error message similar to "Non-system disk or disk error - Replace and press any key when ready". Keep in mind that his message does not means that the system was never booted. It means that the BIOS examined the floppy disk for example and just rejected it because it couldn't boot an operating system. The volume boot code was indeed loaded and executed, as that is what posts the message when it can't find the operating system files.

    In the final stages of the boot process, presuming that the operating system files are found, the boot program will load those operating system files into memory and transfer control to them. In MS-DOS, the first is IO.SYS and its code is executed. IO.SYS will then execute MSDOS.SYS. Then the more complete operating system code loads and initializes the rest of the operating system structures beginning with the command interpreter COMMAND.COM and then the execution of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. At this point the operating system code itself has control of the computer.

If any of the Windows 95/98/ME versions were being started, the above would only be the beginning of the startup process. When MS-DOS starts in anticipation of loading these Windows versions, there are many more routines that are loaded and executed as part of the boot process, which includes such tasks such as reading the system registry, initializing hardware devices and starting the graphical user interface or operating system shell.

boot.img --> MBR, 
bunch of sectors we need to write right after that. should come from a core.img 

The reason we don't have a core.img yet is because it is generated dynamically, 
and we need to tell Grub exactly what modules we want in there,
as well as the disk location we want the kernel to look for additional modules and config files. 
To do just that, we need to use the Grub utility grub-mkimage.

telling grub that it should look at the USB generically and in isolation, and not to consider current OS or disk setup):
to tell Grub to use BIOS/MBR mode (not UEFI/GPT) 
and that we'll have one MBR partition on our USBFlashDrive containing the boot data that's not included in boot.img/core.img 
and that it may need to proceed.
And with BIOS setting our bootable UFD as the first disk (whatever gets booted is usually the first disk BIOS will list), 
we should tell Grub that our disk target is hd0.
Furthermore, the first MBR partition on this drive will be identified as msdos1 
(Grub calls MBR-like partitions msdos#, and GPT partitions gpt#, with the index starting at 1, rather than 0 as is the case for disks).

Thus, if we want to tell Grub that it needs to look for the first MBR partition on our bootable USBFlashDrive device, 
we must specify (hd0,msdos1) as the root for our target.
basic modules we need, so that Grub has the ability to actually identify and read stuff on a partition that may be FAT, NTFS or exFAT. 
you'll need at least biosdisk and part_msdos, and then a module for each type of filesystem you want to be able to access

cd grub-core/
../grub-mkimage -v -O i386-pc -d. -p\(hd0,msdos1\)/boot/grub biosdisk part_msdos fat ntfs exfat -o core.img

Obviously, you could add more file systems,but the one thing you want to pay attention is the size of core.img. 
That's because if you want to keep it safe and stay compatible with the largest choice of disk partitioning tools,
core.img should be below 32KB - 512 bytes. 
The reason is there still exists a bunch of partitioning utilities out there that default to creating their first partition on the second "track" of the disk.
And for most modern disks, including flash drives, a track will be exactly 64 sectors.
To avoid the possibility of overflowing core.img onto your partition data, you really don't want it to be larger than 32256 or 0x7E00 bytes.

so now that we have core.img, it's probably a good idea to create a single partition on our UFD
and format it to either FAT/FAT32, NTFS or exFAT.
and flat-copy both the MBR, a.k.a. boot.img, and core.img onto those first sectors. 

use a regular 512 byte sector size, for the MBR, you need to make sure that only the first 446 bytes of boot.img are copied, 
so as not to overwrite the partition data that also resides in the MBR and that has already been filled.
dd if=boot.img of=/dev/sdb bs=446 count=1
dd if=core.img of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=1 # seek=1 skips the first block (MBR)
nstead of using plain old dd, one could have used Grub's custom grub-bios-setup like this:
../grub-bios-setup -d. -b ./boot.img -c ./core.img /dev/sdb

Grub MUST have loaded the following modules (which you'll find in your grub-core/ directory and that need to be copied on the target into a /boot/grub/i386-pc/ folder):
    boot.mod
    bufio.mod
    crypto.mod
    extcmd.mod
    gettext.mod
    normal.mod
    terminal.mod

Finally, to confirm that everything works, you can add echo.mod to the list above, and create a /boot/grub/grub.cfg on your target with the following:

insmod echo
set timeout=5
 
menuentry "test" {
    echo "hello"
}

Try it, and you should find that your Grub 2 config is executing at long last, whether your target filesystem in FAT, NTFS or exFAT, 
and you can now build custom bootable Grub 2 USBs on top of that.

Some possible error:
while trying to  boot an existing Grub 2 based ISO from USB ,there is a chance that the modules from the ISO and the kernel we use in core 
may have some incompatibility. Especially, you may run into the obnoxious error: symbol 'grub_isprint' not found.
What this basically means is that there is a mismatch between your Grub 2 kernel version and Grub 2 module. 
To fix that you will need to use kernel and modules from the same source.

what is loop partition table ?
parted shows loop as the "partition table" for disks that actually do not have a partition table (whole disk filesystem).

what is loop device?
A Loopback Device is a mechanism used to interpret files as real devices. 
The main advantage of this method is that all tools used on real disks can be used with a loopback device.

A loopback device in Linux is a virtual device that can be used like any other media device. 
The loopback filesystem associates a file on another filesystem as a complete device.
This can then be formatted and mounted just like any of the other devices listed above.
To do this the device called /dev/loop0 or /dev/loop1 etc is associated with the file and then this new virtual device is mounted.

The loop device is a block device that maps its data blocks not to a physical device
but to the blocks of a regular file in a filesystem or to anotherblock device.


Create A File And Loop It As A Filesystem 
-------------------------------------------

1)create a file system in a file within the current file system:
------------------------------------------------------------
dd if=/dev/zero of=file.img bs=1k count=10000  -->  creating a file of a given size
losetup /dev/loop0 file.img  ---> merge a loop device with the file (making loop device a block device instead of just a regular file within the file system)
mke2fs -c /dev/loop0 10000   --->  create a file system on the device with mke2fs

Associating file systems to storage devices in Linux is called mounting.
The mount command is used to attach a file system to a file system hierarchy. 

mkdir /mnt/point1                    --> create mount point
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /mnt/point1 --> The file.img file, symbolized by the loop device (/dev/loop0), is now mounted to the mount point /mnt/point1 using the mount command
ls /mnt/point1   --> this mount point has a  new file system : check by ls command

2) Creating a new loop file system within a loop file system:
---------------------------------------------------------------
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/point1/file.img bs=1k count=1000
losetup /dev/loop1 /mnt/point1/file.img
mke2fs -c /dev/loop1 1000
mkdir /mnt/point2
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop1 /mnt/point2
ls /mnt/point2
ls /mnt/point1








Compiling Grub2 for BIOS and UEFI support on 32/64bit platforms

In order to support BIOS or UEFI booting from both 32 and 64 bit platforms, Grub2 must be compiled for each architecture. To accomplish this, we will create separate containers for each build.

1.) First create a separate working container for each platform,

    mkdir EFI64 EFI32 BIOS

2.) Next to configure and then build for Grub2 64bit UEFI,

a. First change to the EFI64 directory,

    cd EFI64

b. Then to configure and make Grub2 for 64Bit UEFI,

    ../configure --target=x86_64 --with-platform=efi && make

3.) Now to configure and then make for Grub2 32 bit UEFI,

a. Change to the EFI32 directory,

    cd ../EFI32

b. Then to configure and make Grub2 for 32bit UEFI,

    ../configure --target=i386 --with-platform=efi && make

4.) Finally to configure and build for Grub2 BIOS

a. Change to the BIOS directory,

    cd ../BIOS

b. Then to configure and make for BIOS systems,

    ../configure --target=i386 --with-platform=pc --disable-nls && make
    
  
 Grub2 USB Flash Drive Installation

This next section covers the Grub2 installation of all three architectures (64bit UEFI, 32bit UEFI, BIOS) to your USB flash drive.

According to the Grub manual, removable installs require the --removable option (with the exception of i386-pc). When using this, you must also specify --boot-directory and --efi-directory. In addition we'll include the --force option to allow buggy BIOS systems to detect the USB as a Hard Disk.

1.) To install Grub2 64 bit UEFI x86_64-efi,

a. First change to the EFI64 container,

    cd ../EFI64/grub-core

b. Then install x86_64-efi,

    grub-install -d $PWD --force --removable --no-floppy --target=x86_64-efi --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot --efi-directory=/mnt/USB

2.) Then to install Grub2 32 bit UEFI i386-efi,

a. First change to the EFI32 container,

    cd ../../EFI32/grub-core

b. Then install i386-efi,

    grub-install -d $PWD --force --removable --no-floppy --target=i386-efi --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot --efi-directory=/mnt/USB

3.) Finally to put Grub2 BIOS i386-pc,
(replacing  x with your device).

a. First change to the BIOS container,

    cd ../../BIOS/grub-core

b. Then install i386-pc,

    grub-install -d $PWD --force --no-floppy --target=i386-pc --boot-directory=/mnt/USB/boot /dev/sdx
