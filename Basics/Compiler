The main components of any compiler are:

째Parser:The parser converts the raw language source code into assemblylanguage. 
Because you're converting from one format to another (C to assembly), the parser needs to know the target assembly language.

째Assembler:The assembler converts the assembly language code into thebytecode that the CPU executes.

째Linker:The linker combines the individual object files that the assembler generates into an executable application. 
Different operating system and CPU combinations generally use different encapsulation mechanisms and standards.
The linker needs to know this target format to work.

째Standard C library:The core C functions (for example, printf) are provided in a central C library.
