DFU -  device firmware upgrade 

The DFU protocol implementation in U-Boot is much faster than the FEL protocol implementation in the boot ROM 

FEL is still useful for loading the U-Boot bootloader and a bootscript, which may then activate DFU in the following way:
   setenv dfu_alt_info ${dfu_alt_info_ram}
   dfu 0 ram 0
   bootm ${kernel_addr_r} ${ramdisk_addr_r} ${fdt_addr_r}
   The rest of the files can be transferred to the device using the "dfu-util" tool.
   
USB(Device Firmware upgrade)DFU is used to upgrade the various firmwares on the deive 
such as SPL, u-boot, kernel and the filesystem. 
DFU exposes all the nand partitions to host machine as a different USB interfaces.
