tools that allows to build source code into binary code for a  target platform different than the one where the build takes place
▶Different CPU architecture
▶Different ABI
▶Different operating system
▶Different C library

A system definition describes a system: CPU architecture, operating system,vendor, ABI, C library

autoconf system definitions:  represented as tuples
Different forms:
▶<arch>-<vendor>-<os>-<libc/abi>,full form
▶<arch>-<os>-<libc/abi>

▶<arch>, the CPU architecture: arm, mips, powerpc, i386, i686, etc.
▶<vendor>, (mostly) free-form string, ignored byautoconf
▶<os>, the operating system. Eithernoneorlinuxfor the purpose of this talk.
▶<libc/abi>, combination of details on the C library and the ABI in use
