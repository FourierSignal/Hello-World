kernel
kernel is the alternative filename on the boot partition to use when loading the kernel. 
The default value on the Pi 1, Pi Zero, and Compute Module is kernel.img
on the Pi 2, Pi 3, and Compute Module 3 it is kernel7.img.
On the Pi4, it is kernel7l.img.

arm_64bit
If set to non-zero, forces the kernel loading system to assume a 64-bit kernel, 
starts the processors up in 64-bit mode, 
and sets kernel8.img to be the kernel image loaded, unless there is an explicit kernel option defined in which case that is used instead.
Defaults to 0 on all platforms. 
NOTE: 64-bit kernels must be uncompressed image files.
NOTE: 64-bit kernel will only work on the Pi4, Pi3, and Pi2B rev1.2 boards with latest firmware.
