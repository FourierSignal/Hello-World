Building Bare-Metal ARM Systems with GNU
------------------------------------------

 Bare-Metal Targeted Binary Toolchain 
arm-eabi	  32-bit Armv7 Cortex-A, soft-float, little-endian	
aarch64-elf	64-bit Armv8 Cortex-A, little-endian	

The Linaro Toolchain Working Group (TCWG) --- announced stable Release of the Linaro GCC 7 source package.
The GCC 7 series introduced an ABI change for ARM targets by fixing a bug (present since GCC 5, see link below) that affects conformance to the procedure call standard (AAPCS). The bug affects some C++ code where class objects are passed by value to functions and could result in incorrect or inconsistent code being generated. If the option -Wpsabi is enabled (on by default) the compiler will emit a diagnostic note for code that might be affected by this ABI change.

For an explanation of the changes please see the following website:

Startup code??
-------------------
initial code references in the DS example, you can get DS from https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/arm-development-studio/downloads, 
install it on windows, and import the example code, 
File->Import->File System->From Directory(C:\Program Files\ARM\Development Studio 2019.0-1\examples\Bare-metal_examples_Armv8.zip).
