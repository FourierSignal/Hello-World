How to create a sample Project Using Demo Project Provided in FreeRTOS source .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 we do it in two ways  one is crude way and smart way.
 we need to do both the approaches .
 Crude way : helps to understand the FreeRTOS source structure.
              and purpose and structure of Demo codes in FreeRTOS source( provided for quick start)
	      and to get understanding in more generic way : irrespective of IDE, compiler,Platform.

Smart way: Doing the things fast using IDE (here iam using LPCexresso from nxp)

Crude way :
--------------------------
  
FreeRTOSv10.0.0.zip --->extract FreeRTOSv10.0.0
It has two directories : FreeRTOS and FreeRTOS-Plus
FreeRTOS ---> has FreeRTOS kernel source common to all the platforms
              port files specific to each Platform
			  and demo - for each of Platform-compiler-combination
			  
FreeRTOS-Plus--->


Creating a Project using Demo project Available in FreeRTOS source:

create Directory - Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x
copy contents of FreeRTOS directory contents into Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x
dir  Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x ---> Demo , License, Source, + other readme files

Demo --> contains demo for each combination of 
Source -> contains FreeRTOS kernel files and port directories for each platform.

remove License and other readme files (optional)
In the dir Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo:
keep common and CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso directories - which are the rwquired platform
remove all other demo directories.

In the Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Source :
keep freertos kernel files 
In the port layer -Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Source\portable:
keep common , Memmang,required compiler + arch- combination , + any other required directory
like Tasking which is required for CM4F
remove all other directories 
 
 - in this case keep GCC, common, MemMang
 
 





								 
In the 	CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso -- there are two directories RTOSDemo and CMSISv2p00_LPC11xx

dir  Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo\CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso\RTOSDemo	--->							  
.cproject , .project , CreateProjectDirectoryStructure

dir Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo\CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso\CMSISv2p00_LPC11xx --->
.cproject , .project , src , inc, docs , history

As per history file:
CMSISv2p00_LPC11xx is a Library project created using 
files as supplied in ARM's CMSIS 2.0 
+ together with device/board specific files from NXP (which were
also part of CMSISv1p30_LPC11xx library project )

RTOSDemo is sample Project - which is provided for user.
It has source files for project and project files , script to create Project directory structure.
The Source directory   Application files + FreeRTOSConfig.h File + cr_startup_lpc11.c file
Application files  -->
FreeRTOSConfig.h File -->
cr_startup_lpc11.c file --->
CreateProjectDirectoryStructure -->  
It creates the directory:FreeRTOS_Source under Application Project source:RTOSDemo\Source
 Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo\CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso\RTOSDemo\Source
copies FreeRTOS source files from  Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Source : which has FreeRTOS kerenel Files and port Files

# Now we are ready with Minimal FreeRTos Source that is required for our Platform.
Summary:
Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x ---> Letus call this project preperation directory. This is not our Project directory.

Here we have two directories Source and Demo
Source -- has Minimal FreeRTOS source which we want to copy into our Project.
Demo --- has demo code for our platform code and common demo code for all Platforms.

Now we are going to create a Project under the dir: Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo\CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso
It has two directories :
CMSISv2p00_LPC11xx --> this is going to be the Project directory for CIMSIS Library 
RTOSDemo ---> this is going to be our Application project.

Let us rename our Application Project as Webserver.
Remove all the contents of Dir: Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo\CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso\Webserver
Remove all the contents of CMSISv2p00_LPC11xx

Launch LPCexpresso IDE.
select the workspace as : Project1_cortexM0_LPC11x\Demo\CORTEX_M0_LPC1114_LPCXpresso

C:\Users\suvelise\Documents\3_Embedded_rel\ARM_cortex_M4\DSP_nxp_projects\FreeRTOS\FreeRTOSv10.0.0.exe





we need to run the script  CreateProjectDirectoryStructure at this point .
without running scrit-if we Import project It complains Later and asks to run the script .

if we don't run the script :CreateProjectDirectoryStructure here ?? go ahed and Launch lpcexpresso
