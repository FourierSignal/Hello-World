CCLK --> ARM cpu input clock
osc_clk ---> oscillator clock
pll_clkin --> i/p to PLL

if pll0 is inactive osc_clk = pll_clkin

======================
LPC1768 CLOCKING:
======================



three independent oscillators:  Main Oscillator,  Internal RC Oscillator, RTC oscillator.


Internal RC Oscillator:      The nominal IRC frequency is 4 MHz.
------------------------
Reset----> the LPC176x/5x will operate from the Internal RC Oscillator until switched by software.

Internal RC Oscillator (IRC):can be used for the WDT, to drives PLL0 and subsequently the CPU.
IRC can't be used for USB interface.
The precision of the IRC <  precise time base in order to comply with the USB specification



Main oscillator:   operates at frequencies of 1 MHz to 25 MHz.
---------------- 
This frequency can be boosted to a higher frequency, up to the maximum CPU operating frequency(120 MHz), by Main PLL (PLL0).
main oscillator can be used as the clock source for the CPU, with or without using PLL0.


RTC oscillator.:
-----------------


PLL0 and PLL1:
----------------

PLL0 : used by the CPU, peripherals, and optionally the USB subsystem
PLL1 : dedicated to USB subsystem.


PLL0: (turned off by default)
------
 PLLclkin range : 32 kHz to 50 MHz
 Any of the three clock sources can be chosen to drive PLL0 and ultimately the CPU and on-chip peripheral devices.

 Only the main oscillator must be used (via PLL0) as the clock source for the USBsubsystem.
 The IRC or RTC oscillators do not provide the proper tolerances.

The input frequency is multiplied up to a high frequency, then divided down to provide the actual clock as per pheripheral/cpu.


PLLCLKin---> Initially divided by N(1 to 256) ---->Multiplier (by M---> 6 through 512) 
---> PLL-->stable freq pllclk----> additional dividers as required by pheripheral


PLL1:
-------
       i/p freq is only from main oscillator (in the range of 10 MHz to 25 MHz only)
       o/p freq is fixed 48 MHz clock only to the USB subsystem.it is insured that the output of PLL1 has a 50% duty cycle.
