audio processing application need to capture a ton (~100,000) tiny UDP packets per second.
real-time requirements(latency/jitter)  to deliver smooth audio places bigger constraint on npcap.
But if they're willing to process things in batches as long as they don't truly fall behind, 
then Npcap can be tuned to support some very high throughputs.
you can process the packets as fast as possible from the libpcap API standpoint.
using pcap_getevent() to get a handle for each pcap descriptor and using WaitForMultipleObjects to ensure  Read only when it's appropriate.
