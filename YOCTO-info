BITBAKE:
-----------------

BitBake: is make-like build tool, with special focus of distributions and packages for embedded Linux cross compilation.

BitBake recipes:  specify how a particular package is built. 
                  During the build process, recipes are used to track dependencies, performing native or cross-compilation of the package
                  and package it (ipk, deb, rpm), so that it is suitable for installation on the local or a target device.
                  complete images: kernel+rootfs(with pkgs) can also be created

Recipes--have -> source URL (http, https, ftp, cvs, svn, git, local file system) of the package
                 dependencies and compile or install options.
                 metadata for the package in standard variables.
                 setup cross compile toolchain
                 and crossbuild.
                 
BitBake existed for some time in the OpenEmbedded project .  it was separated out into a standalone, maintained, distribution-independent
tool. BitBake is co-maintained by the Yocto Project and the OpenEmbedded project.  


OPEN EMBEDDED :
OpenEmbedded is a build automation framework and cross-compile environment used to create Linux distributions for embedded devices.
The OpenEmbedded framework is developed by the OpenEmbedded community, which was formally established in 2003.
OpenEmbedded is the recommended build system of the Yocto Project, which is a Linux Foundation workgroup.



YOCTO:
The Yocto Project is Linux Foundation collaborative open source project 
whose goal is to produce tools and processes that enable the creation of Linux distributions for embedded and IoT software
that are independent of the underlying architecture of the embedded hardware.
The project was announced by the Linux Foundation in 2010 in collaboration with 22 organizations, including OpenEmbedded.



 A key part of YOCTO is the OpenEmbedded build system: which enables developers to create their own Linux distribution
 specific to their environment.
 
 The Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded Project share maintainership of 
 the main parts of the OpenEmbedded build system: the build engine, BitBake, and the core metadata, OpenEmbedded-Core.
 
 POKY:
  The Yocto Project provides a reference implementation called Poky, 
  which contains the OpenEmbedded build system  + a large set of recipes, arranged in a hierarchical system of layers,
  that can be used as a fully functional template for a customized embedded operating system.
  
  
 Sub-projects under YOCTO project: (Apart from OpenEmbedded build system)
   CROPS, pseudo, cross-prelink, Eclipse integration, the matchbox suite of applications, and many others. 
   One of the central goals of the project is interoperability among these tools.
