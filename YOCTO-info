BITBAKE:
-----------------

BitBake: is make-like build tool, with special focus of distributions and packages for embedded Linux cross compilation.

BitBake recipes:  specify how a particular package is built. 
                  During the build process, recipes are used to track dependencies, performing native or cross-compilation of the package
                  and package it so that it is suitable for installation on the local or a target device.
                  complete images: kernel+rootfs(with pkgs) can also be created

Recipes--have -> source URL (http, https, ftp, cvs, svn, git, local file system) of the package
                 dependencies and compile or install options.
                 metadata for the package in standard variables.
                 setup cross compile toolchain
                 and crossbuild.
                 
BitBake existed for some time in the OpenEmbedded project .  it was separated out into a standalone, maintained, distribution-independent
tool. BitBake is co-maintained by the Yocto Project and the OpenEmbedded project.
