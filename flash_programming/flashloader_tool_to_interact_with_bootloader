Open source flash program for the STM32 ARM processors using the ST serial bootloader over UART or I2C

programming over i2c,spi,usb also possible,in general 

ST-bootloader(Application Note:AN2606)
bootloader is stored in the internal boot ROM memory (system memory) of STM32
devices. It is programmed by ST during production. Its main task is to download the
application program to the internal Flash memory through one of the available serial
peripherals (USART, CAN, USB, I2C, SPI, etc.). A communication protocol is defined for
each serial interface, with a compatible command set and sequences.
