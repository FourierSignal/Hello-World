CMSIS-DAP: Cortex microcontroller software interface standard specification and a implementation of a Firmware
           that supports access to DAP(Debug Access Port):

Target device: ARM processors(CM3/CM4): has CoreSight IP: that provides Debug and Trace.
this ARM Device provides a Debug Access Port (DAP) :
 typically either with a 5-pin JTAG(joint Test Action Group)
               or with a 2-pin Serial Wired Debug(SWD)-interface

CMSIS-DAP is is generally implemented as an on-board interface chip
provides usb connection from host to coresight DAP over JTAG/SWD wire interface.



the CMSIS-DAP Firmware is provided as source code:
The CMSIS-DAP Software Stack is composed of the following components:
CMSIS-DAP Firmware that interfaces to JTAG or SWD Debug pins using standard I/O pins of the Cortex-M device.
CMSIS-Driver USART that connects the UART of the Cortex-M device to the SWO output from the target.
USB Communication Stack that interfaces to the USB Port of the Host Computer using the HID or custom class.
The USB Device middleware may require CMSIS-RTOS and a CMSIS-Driver USB.

You can debug with any IDE that supports the CMSIS-DAP protocol.

or you can use openOCD for interacting with DAP-port.
