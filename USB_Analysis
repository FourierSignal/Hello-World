When a device plugs into a port, the deviceâ€™s pull-up brings its line high,
enabling the hub to detect that a device is attached
The hub detects the device.

Each hub uses its interrupt endpoint
to report events at the hub. The report indicates only whether the hub or a
port (and if so, which port) has experienced an event
