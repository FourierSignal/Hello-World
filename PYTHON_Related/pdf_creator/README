FPDF is a Python class that allows generating PDF files with Python code
??

FPDF is a PHP class which allows to generate PDF files with pure PHP, that is to say without using the PDFlib library 
PyFPDF is
“… a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP 


FPDF stands for Free PDF.It is free to use and it does not require any API keys.
features of this class are:
 allows :page format and margin,to manage page header and footer,PNG, GIF and JPG support,
 
 
 the generation speed of the document is less than with PDFlib. 
 However, the performance penalty keeps very reasonable and suits in most cases, unless your documents are particularly complex or heavy.
 
 
making Python applications installable on linux:

 dh_virtualenv tool: It builds a .deb package that wraps a Python virtual environment around an application and deploys it upon installing.
 apt-get install dh-virtualenv devscripts
 create a directory to keep the source: 
 mkdir medical_prescr
 create the debian/control file:
 
Source: medical_prescriptions
Section: python
Priority: extra
Maintainer: Jan Doe <jandoe@example.org>
Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9), python3.7, dh-virtualenv (>= 0.8)
Standards-Version: 3.9.5

Package: medical_prescriptions
Architecture: any
Pre-Depends: dpkg (>= 1.16.1), python3.7, ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: pdf creator with images 
Useful for doing stuff

debian/compat file, which exists mostly for historical purposes:
echo "9" > debian/compat


create the changelog to tell package users what has changed since the last release. The easiest way is to use dch --create to create a template and then fill in the values.

pip-compile requirements.in > requirements.txt
This will produce a strict dependency file called requirements.txt


Finally, write a debian/rules file for creating the package. Since dh_virtualenv does all the hard work, the rules file is simple:

#!/usr/bin/make -f

%:
        dh $@ --with python-virtualenv --python /usr/bin/python3.7



build the package:
$ debuild -b -us -uc
This will produce a file in the parent directory with a name like myhttp_2.0.0-1_amd64.deb. This file can be installed on any compatible operating system.
