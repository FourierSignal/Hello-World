convert a given text to PDF
FPDF is a Python class that allows generating PDF files with Python code
??

FPDF is a PHP class which allows to generate PDF files with pure PHP, that is to say without using the PDFlib library 
PyFPDF is
“… a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP 


FPDF stands for Free PDF.It is free to use and it does not require any API keys.
features of this class are:
 allows :page format and margin,to manage page header and footer,PNG, GIF and JPG support,
 
 
 the generation speed of the document is less than with PDFlib. 
 However, the performance penalty keeps very reasonable and suits in most cases, unless your documents are particularly complex or heavy.
 
 
making Python applications installable on linux:

 dh_virtualenv tool: It builds a .deb package that wraps a Python virtual environment around an application and deploys it upon installing.
 apt-get install dh-virtualenv devscripts
 create a directory to keep the source: 
 mkdir medical_prescr
 create the debian/control file:
 
Source: medical_prescriptions
Section: python
Priority: extra
Maintainer: Jan Doe <jandoe@example.org>
Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9), python3.7, dh-virtualenv (>= 0.8)
Standards-Version: 3.9.5

Package: medical_prescriptions
Architecture: any
Pre-Depends: dpkg (>= 1.16.1), python3.7, ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: pdf creator with images 
Useful for doing stuff

debian/compat file, which exists mostly for historical purposes:
echo "9" > debian/compat


create the changelog to tell package users what has changed since the last release. The easiest way is to use dch --create to create a template and then fill in the values.

pip-compile requirements.in > requirements.txt
This will produce a strict dependency file called requirements.txt


Finally, write a debian/rules file for creating the package. Since dh_virtualenv does all the hard work, the rules file is simple:

#!/usr/bin/make -f

%:
        dh $@ --with python-virtualenv --python /usr/bin/python3.7



build the package:
$ debuild -b -us -uc
This will produce a file in the parent directory with a name like myhttp_2.0.0-1_amd64.deb. This file can be installed on any compatible operating system.



PDF page turner software : 
Flipsnack 

How to add the PDF page turning effect
PDF page transitions in HTML5
With Flipsnack you can create a HTML5 page flip PDF easily. 

Perhaps you’ve seen other interesting page transitions for PDF presentations, created in InDesign.
Truthfully, Flipsnack is not the only tool that can be used to make PDF pages interactive.
It’s possible to create some interesting page transition effects in InDesign or with other online tools, but beware the Flash.
Flash is an outdated technology that was very popular once. 
Now it’s prone to vulnerabilities, so browsers are blocking all Flash content. 
Despite these issues, most flipbook makers are still Flash-based, so they should be avoided. 



First, the effect that you are trying to achieve is called a "Page Turn." From everything I know, there isn't any way to get that effect in an actual PDF document.
The only way I know to do that is to convert your PDF file into a Flash (swf) document. There the Page Turn transition is easy to create.
I create these Flash documents using the Export as SWF feature in InDesign.
 However, there are quite a few third-party products that will convert your PDF into a Flash document. (Ironically this is not something that native Adobe products do.)
But remember, the final document will not be a PDF. People will have to have the Flash Reader, not the Adobe Reader, to open the file.
It might be a good idea to look at how the final document will be distributed and played, before you decide on a transition effect


If you use InDesign CS4 (or 5) to create your layout, this may interest you:

Not PDF, but very easy way to get pageturn effect + other controls to your publication...



PDF itself is more like a readable file than a page flip book. While, Flash files support that kinda animated effect.
To make page flip book from PDF, I reommend this one http://www.pdf-to-flash-magazine.com/ , 
Both free online conversion and offline software download are offered, not to mention the wonderful page-flip effect they made.


Try something like a PDF to Flash Magazine converter,  You can take advantage of a good and mature software instead of developing one yourself.
Still, some open sources for page flip which had great use in animation.

Issuu: an online open source service can turn uploaded PDF into a page flipping book.
2. Page Flip flap: A free online tool that can accept PDF and create page flippable books

I recommend using Impressive: It's a presentation software written in Python and running on Windows, Linux and Macintosh. Amongst other transition effects, it supports two page flipping effects, PagePeel and PageTurn. The transitions can be configured in a text file.

Example

If you have a presentation mytalk.pdf, create a text file called mytalk.pdf.info. In order to use e. g. the PageTurn effect between slide 1 and 2 and to use no transitions in the rest of the presentation, the contents of this file would look like this:

DocumentTitle = "My talk"
PageProps = {
  1: {
       'transition': PageTurn
     }
}
AvailableTransitions = [None]
More information on how to configure the appearance of your presentations can be found in the Impressive manual.







Accessibility is very important for your stylish PDF presentation, right?
