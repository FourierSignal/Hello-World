  design model coded in the HDL
 
 compilation:  analyzing the source code for syntax and semantic errors.
 
 
 Elaboration:  binds modules to module instances, builds the model hierarchy, computes parameter values, resolves hierarchical names,
                establishes net connectivity, and prepares all of this for simulation
                
An HDL description of the design would consist of several concurrent process , assignments and some connections between then.                
               
Simulation :  is the process in which HDL code gets executed (after a successful compilation and elaboration) based on a given execution model.
              Most HDL simulators uses an event based execution model. 
              Changes in signals/nets will trigger evaluation of all dependent processes and further updates of other events.
              
 notion of time in simulation:  evaluation proceeds by execution of process in a current time slot and moves on to next time slot
