It is  simpler to just use a Linux VM. --> use docker.

If you want to compile on mac itself :
--------------------------------
(the default HFS filesystem on mac is case insensitive.)
Before you can even start, you may need to install the Linux source tree on a case-sensitive filesystem on your Mac. 

you'll need the following files to cross-compile a kernel on an OS X (to your local /usr/include): copy them from any linux system.
/usr/include/elf.h
/usr/include/features.h
/usr/include/bits/predefs.h
/usr/include/bits/wordsize.h
/usr/include/gnu/stubs.h
/usr/include/gnu/stubs-64.h
