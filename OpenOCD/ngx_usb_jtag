General procedure:
------------------------

The command line consists of configuration files prefixed by -f, and commands prefixed by -c. In reality, a configuration file is just a series of commands; 
eg:
openocd -c "transport select jtag"  ==  openocd -f select_jtag.cfg where the file ‘select_jtag.cfg’ has the line:   transport select jtag


sudo openocd -f rpi2.cfg \
             -c "transport select swd" \
             -c "adapter_khz 1000" \
             -f target/stm32f1x.cfg






cd ~/OpenOCD/OpenOCD_install/bin



/openocd   -f ../share/openocd/scripts/interface/ftdi/ngxtech.cfg
