Host --------------- JTAG Adapter--------------- Target.




General procedure:
------------------------

The command line consists of configuration files prefixed by -f, and commands prefixed by -c. In reality, a configuration file is just a series of commands; 
eg:
openocd -c "transport select jtag"  ==  openocd -f select_jtag.cfg where the file ‘select_jtag.cfg’ has the line:   transport select jtag


sudo openocd -f rpi2.cfg \
             -c "transport select swd" \
             -c "adapter_khz 1000" \
             -f target/stm32f1x.cfg


OpenOCD has a wide variety of options, so generally needs more than one configuration file, to define:

    1) Debug adaptor (in our case, ngx usb jtag)
    2)Communication method (SWD or JTAG)
    3)Target CPU. (Rpi3)
