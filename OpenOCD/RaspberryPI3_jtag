JTAG functionality is exposed in GPIO pins as alternative functions.
Therefore, in order to use it, these pins has to be configured accordingly in order to be able to access ARM JTAG Debugging capability.

There are a few different ways to do it.
the easiest one is to add enable_jtag_gpio=1 directive to config.txt and reboot you will have JTAG on ALT4 pins.

we need to run a infinite loop program on Rpi3 board.
It is the minimum possible program you can write, since we need to boot something 
so that otherwise the board does not come to a state that we can connect with JTAG
