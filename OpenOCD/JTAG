Host ------------ JTAG adapter ---------- Target


The connector pins are:

    TDI (Test Data In)
    TDO (Test Data Out)
    TCK (Test Clock)
    TMS (Test Mode Select)
    TRST (Test Reset) optional.
    
    
    

The host communicates with the TAPs 
by manipulating TMS and TDI in conjunction with TCK, and reading results through TDO (which is the only standard host-side input).

TMS/TDI/TCK output transitions create the basic JTAG communication primitive on which higher layer protocols build:
