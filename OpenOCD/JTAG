Joint Test Action Group is a standard for a generic transportinterface for integrated circuits.
Boundary scan - read the outputs of the pins
Debugging - if a board has debug ports (TAP - test access port)


JTAG specifies the use of a dedicated debug port implementing a serial communications interface
for low-overhead access without requiring direct external access to the system address and data buses.

The interface connects to an on-chip Test Access Port (TAP) that implements a stateful protocol 
to access a set of test registers that present chip logic levels and device capabilities of various parts. 



Host ------------ JTAG adapter ---------- Target




The connector pins are:

    TDI (Test Data In)
    TDO (Test Data Out)
    TCK (Test Clock)
    TMS (Test Mode Select)
    TRST (Test Reset) optional.
    



In JTAG, devices expose one or more test access ports (TAPs).
TAPS might be individual chips or might be modules inside one chip.
A daisy chain of TAPs is called a scan chain, or (loosely) a target.

Each TAP has an instruction register (IR) and a data register (DR). The size of those registers varies between TAPs.

The host communicates with the TAPs 
by manipulating TMS and TDI in conjunction with TCK, and reading results through TDO (which is the only standard host-side input).

TMS/TDI/TCK output transitions create the basic JTAG communication primitive on which higher layer protocols build:
