            parenthetical phrase( she was ebullient,where he was glum,relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was __________ )
            
Analysis:  dependent clause : while, in many ways their personalities could not have been more different,
           independent clause : they were surprisingly well suited.
           while denotes that there should be contrast between two phrases.
           
           their personalities could not have been more different in many ways ==> in reality their personalities  are different in every way.
           
           while their personalities are quite different in every aspect, surprisingly they were well suited.
           
           parenthetical phrase should indicate the fact that their personalities are differet 
            ebullient X glum ; relaxed X awkward; garrulous X taciturn
            
strategy : since blank is in parenthetical phrase just follow the direction in which the prase is going, and substitute answers.
           
           crosscheck answer by understanding dependent clause : could not have been (wishing) =  have been (in reality)
                                                                  could have been  = have not been
                                                                  could not have been =  not (have not been) = !(have not been) = have been
                                                                  
             ==> attack what is confusing you ?? 
              while their pesonalities  could not have been more different, they are well suited.                                                     
              "could not have been more different" --->  understand usage of could., a sort of mathemaical and intutive analysis to reduce this expression.

           new form of protectionism  reminds mercentilism
           ==> economic competition result in older form of protectionism 
           : ==> equilance of sentence 
            such protectionism ==> old type of protectionism is coming back
           coming back / reoccuring  = (resurgent,recrudescent)

           earlier age : old protectionism ( mercantilism was the protectionism )
           current : economic competetion result in  new form of protectionism 
           
           new protectionism reminds  mercantilism (old protectionism)
           colon : ==> equival sentences
           such protectionism = old protectionism  is reoccuring
