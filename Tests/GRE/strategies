SENTENCE EQUIVALENCE
----------------------
1. group the synonyms . eliminate those which dont form pair.
2. simplify the statement.
3. apply one of the startegy. and get to the result.
list of strategies: word-contrast, time-contrast, previously-referenced, block-of-four
4. divide statement into clauses and  cross-check the result of strategy


TEXT COMPLETION:
----------------
1.ignore the choices.
2.simplify the statement
3. Analyse statement to get answer.
4. if could not solve, try solving through applying strategy.
5. comeup with possible word
6. check the choices and elminate wrong.


Math-problem:
-------------
identified by colon. balance the equation



Previously-referenced:
-----------------------
article-the may help to identify.



word-contrast:
------------------

time-contrast
---------------
identify two periods of time.
identifying words: befeore,

compare/contrast between the periods.
this may/maynot  reduce to block of four.



Block-of-four
--------------

  identify four elements of sentence.
  one of them is blank.
  find relation between two of those elements.
  this helps to find out the relation ship between other two.==> which gives the blank.



Pairing strategy:
-----------------
( for SE questions)
look for synonym pairs in six answer choices of SE question.
there are usually two pairs,some times one, at times none/three.
there can be strong pairs or maybe-pairs.
elminate options which are not pairs.-- this will reduce to 50:50 tie between remaining pairs.



1)easiest blank first.other blanks will reveal.
2)flexibility to use multiple tools. not to be rigid in approch/tool/startegy/method to solve.
