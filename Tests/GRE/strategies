SENTENCE EQUIVALENCE
----------------------
1. group the synonyms . eliminate those which dont form pair.
2. simplify the statement.
3. apply one of the startegy. and get to the result.
list of strategies: word-contrast, time-contrast, previously-referenced, block-of-four
4. divide statement into clauses and  cross-check the result of strategy


TEXT COMPLETION:
----------------
1.ignore the choices.
2.simplify the statement
3. Analyse statement to get answer.
4. if could not solve, try solving through applying strategy.
5. comeup with possible word
6. check the choices and elminate wrong.





Strategy VS Analysis:
----------------------
Analysis is always best method : this is because this is the intended purpose of test.
It is more accurate and always  result in getting to the right answer. 

Strategy helps if you are stuck because of lack of vocabulary/time.
strategy always may not result in correct answer.but sometimes it may help.
there are various strategies. use appropriate one for the question.
flexibility to use multiple tools. not to be rigid in approch/tool/startegy/method to solve.





Pairing strategy:
-----------------
( for SE questions)
look for synonym pairs in six answer choices of SE question.
there are usually two pairs,some times one, at times none/three.
there can be strong pairs or maybe-pairs.
elminate options which are not pairs.-- this will reduce to 50:50 tie between remaining pairs.
some times if sentence is tough to understand, just selct most closer synonyms and wait for your luck till the result comes.



Math-problem:
-------------
identified by colon. balance the equation



Previously-referenced:
-----------------------
article-the may help to identify.



word-contrast:
------------------
identify contrasting words in the sentence.
identifying words:  belies



time-contrast
---------------

this may/maynot  reduce to block of four.



Block-of-four
--------------

  identify four elements of sentence.
