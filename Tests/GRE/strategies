SENTENCE EQUIVALENCE
----------------------
1. group the synonyms . eliminate those which dont form pair.
2. simplify the statement.
3. apply one of the startegy. and get to the result.
list of strategies: word-contrast, time-contrast, previously-referenced, block-of-four
4. divide statement into clauses and  cross-check the result of strategy


TEXT COMPLETION:
----------------
1.ignore the choices.
2.simplify the statement
3. Analyse statement to get answer.

In the 1950s, the country’s inhabitants were _____________ : most of them knew very little about foreign countries.
A. partisan F. erudite G. insular H. cosmopolitan I. imperturbable

simplify:  country’s inhabitants are ____  ==  they know liitle about foreign countries

strategy:     treat colon as ==('equal to')
              they know little about foreign countries  is -ve 
              countries inhabitants were __  should be -ve
              Here  sentences are pretty simple so math-analysis wont help that much.
              but if sentence is confusing with words like not,few,relely etc...it comes handy.
              
              comeup with word describing --- know little of other countries.
              check answer choices.
              partisan, insular are negative ---> mostly one of them.
              partisan = biased so elminate
              insular  is correct answer.
Analysis:  insular = 'gnorant of or uninterested in cultures, ideas, or peoples outside one's own experience' .
            having good  vocabulary helps to solve this problem.

Given how (i) ____________ the shortcomings of the standard economic model are in its portrayals of human behavior,
the failure of many economists to respond to them is astonishing. 
They continue to fill the journals with yet more proofs of yet more (ii) ___________ theorems.
Others, by contrast, accept the criticisms as a challenge, seeking to expand the basic model to embrace a wider range of things people do.
Blank (i)
A. overlooked B. occasional C. patent
Blank (ii)
D. comprehensive E. improbable F. pervasive

simplify :  

Analyse:   1. first blank is an adjective which describes the short comings of standard model.
           this adjective should tell why the failure to respond to those shortcomings  is astonishing.
           
           It is astonishing that many economists did not responded to shortcomings => when it will be astonishing?
          
           If shortcomings are very silly/easy to be solved.but the are not solving. 
           If shortcomings are very obvious.but no one respond to them.
           If shortcomings are abundant.
           If shortcomings are significant.
           
           trap: overlooked seems plausible.
               If given that shortcomings are very often overlooked, it wont be surprising to know that many economists failed to respond.
           elminate overlooked and occasional
           patent ~ obvious : correct answer.
          
            
            2. they  vs others : contrast
              they-- fill journals with yet more proofs of yet more ______ theorems. adjective describing theorems..
              others -- seeks to expand the model
              
              they --> might  not be  seeking to expand/correct/change model ==> so theorems carry the shortcomings.
