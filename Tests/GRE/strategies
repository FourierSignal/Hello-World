            parenthetical phrase( she was ebullient,where he was glum,relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was __________ )
            
Analysis:  dependent clause : while, in many ways their personalities could not have been more different,
           independent clause : they were surprisingly well suited.
           while denotes that there should be contrast between two phrases.
           
           their personalities could not have been more different in many ways ==> in reality their personalities  are different in every way.

            ebullient X glum ; relaxed X awkward; garrulous X taciturn
            
strategy : since blank is in parenthetical phrase just follow the direction in which the prase is going, and substitute answers.
           
           crosscheck answer by understanding dependent clause : could not have been (wishing) =  have been (in reality)
                                                                  could have been  = have not been
                                                                  could not have been =  not (have not been) = !(have not been) = have been
                                                                  
             ==> attack what is confusing you ?? 
              while their pesonalities  could not have been more different, they are well suited.                                                     
              "could not have been more different" --->  understand usage of could., a sort of mathemaical and intutive analysis to reduce this expression.
