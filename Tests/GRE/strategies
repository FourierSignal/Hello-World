SENTENCE EQUIVALENCE
----------------------
1. group the synonyms . eliminate those which dont form pair.
2. simplify the statement.
3. apply one of the startegy. and get to the result.
list of strategies: word-contrast, time-contrast, previously-referenced, block-of-four
4. divide statement into clauses and  cross-check the result of strategy


TEXT COMPLETION:
----------------
1.ignore the choices.
2.simplify the statement
3. Analyse statement to get answer.
4. if could not solve, try solving through applying strategy.
5. comeup with possible word
6. check the choices and elminate wrong.





Strategy VS Analysis:
----------------------
Analysis is always best method : this is because this is the intended purpose of test.
It is more accurate and always  result in getting to the right answer. 

Strategy helps if you are stuck because of lack of vocabulary/time.
strategy always may not result in correct answer.but sometimes it may help.
there are various strategies. use appropriate one for the question.
flexibility to use multiple tools. not to be rigid in approch/tool/startegy/method to solve.





Pairing strategy:
-----------------
( for SE questions)
look for synonym pairs in six answer choices of SE question.
there are usually two pairs,some times one, at times none/three.
there can be strong pairs or maybe-pairs.
elminate options which are not pairs.-- this will reduce to 50:50 tie between remaining pairs.
some times if sentence is tough to understand, just selct most closer synonyms and wait for your luck till the result comes.


easiest blank first.
-------------------
identify easy blank
other blanks will reveal.

substitute any prev-references:
--------------------------------
identify pronouns and other references and substitute previous words to ease the understanding of sentence

article "the" -->
eg:
                     hardly _____ kind of story  ,  ghost story is almost/best models the form
                     hardly _____ kind of story  ,  ghost story is almost/best models  the story.




Math-problem:
-------------
indentify the punctuation/functional grammatical word that indicates the relationship between two parts of sentence.
balance the equation by assigning -ve/+ve to grammatical words( do not assign values to nouns).

we are basically evaluating sentence structure and the direction of flow of logic.
Since sentence may be confusing some times, assigning signs to grammatical entities and balancing parts of sentence
will help in guessing the word, atleast the kind of word(+ve/-ve),especially when lot of lot of nots and other -ve entities are cconfusing.

eg:



identified by colon,comma



Previously-referenced:
-----------------------
article-the may help to identify.



word-contrast:
------------------
identify contrasting words in the sentence.
identifying words:  belies

this may/maynot  reduce to block of four.


time-contrast
---------------
identify two periods of time.
identifying words: befeore,

compare/contrast between the periods.
this may/maynot  reduce to block of four.



Block-of-four
--------------

  identify four elements of sentence.
  one of them is blank.
  find relation between two of those elements.
  this helps to find out the relation ship between other two.==> which gives the blank.
