STM32 with no MMU (meaning STM32F/H with around 2 MB flash and 0.5 MB RAM).

our own OS, It should behave like a very small linux.
No, we don't wanna run linux on the MCU as linux is huge,

The OS should run directly from flash and the user programs should be able to run from flash and ram.
We created loader for relocatable runtime using standard gcc-none-eabi, but it doesn't do everything we need.
it would be nice to change gcc's behavior regarding register R9 - then it could be running smoothly.



ucLinux was a project forked from the Linux kernel long back with the aim to develop Kernel for MMU less systems. 
However, after a certain while, it was merged to the parent Linux branch. So, today there doesn't exist any active ucLinux distribution.
So, if you disable MMU from the mainline kernel configuration, you'll get an MMU-less version. 
In fact, now there are configuration options provided in the kernel itself whereby a user can specify the memory layout and the access permissions.
